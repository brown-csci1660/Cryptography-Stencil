To use this program, use the following command on a terminal:

python main.py < pairs.txt

where pairs.txt is the file with your plaintext ciphertext pairs.


You may also simply run

python main.py pairs.txt

if you don't like piping files to stdin for some reason


Note that this implementation assumes you are using Python 2 and will certainly be an order of magnitude slower than the go version. For reference, the TA's Python solution takes about 20 minutes to run.
