# Go stencil

This folder contains Go stencil code for the Cryptography
project.  To use it, please copy the contents of this folder to the
main directory for this problem (ie, `grades`, `ivy`, etc.).

## Building your code

In order for the autograder to build your code, you must include a
`Makefile` in the main directory such that running `make` performs all
steps necessary to compile your code.  Specifically, running `make` in
the problem directory should produce an executable called `sol` that
can be run as directed in the assignment.  

A sample `Makefile` has been provided as part of this stencil--this
should be sufficient for most situations.  If you add more .go files
or use any external packages, you may need to adjust this Makefile to
suit your needs.  

If you have questions on using Makefiles, feel free to ask for help!
